<h1>Python</h1>
<p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
It is used for:web development (server-side),software development,mathematics,system scripting.</p>
<h2>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.</h2>
<h3>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc)</h3>
<p>The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.</p>
